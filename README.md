# DOM Practice

## Instructions

1. Clone this repository

2. Open `index.html` in your browser

3. Implement solutions in `index.js` to each exercise

**HINT**: Hints are available in the `hints` directory and solutions in `solutions` for each
exercise. These folders also have all hints and solutions in a file called `all.js`.

Try completing each exercise on your own, before checking the hints or solutions.

Good luck!
